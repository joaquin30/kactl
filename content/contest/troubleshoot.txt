Wrong answer:
Print your solution!
Is your output format correct? (including whitespace)
Do you handle all corner cases correctly?
Have you understood the problem correctly?
Can your algorithm handle the whole range of input?
Are you sure your algorithm works?
What special cases have you not thought of?
Are you sure the STL functions you use work as you think?
Read the full problem statement again.
Create some testcases to run your algorithm on.
Go through this list again.
Go through the algorithm for a simple case.
Explain your algorithm to a team mate.
Ask the team mate to look at your code.
Rewrite your solution from the start or let a team mate do it.
Are you clearing all datastructures between test cases?
Go for a small walk, e.g. to the toilet.

Runtime error:
Have you tested all corner cases locally?
Are you reading or writing outside the range of any vector?
Any possible division by 0? (mod 0 for example)
Any possible infinite recursion?

Time limit exceeded:
Do you have any possible infinite loops?
What is the complexity of your algorithm?
Are you copying a lot of unneccessary data? (References)
How big is the input and output?
What do your team mates think about your algorithm?

Memory limit exceeded:
What is the max amount of memory your algorithm should need?
Do you have any memory leaks? (use STL instead)
Are you clearing all datastructures between test cases?

Output limit exceeded:
Did you remove all debug printing?
Can your output loop run amok?
