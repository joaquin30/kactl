\subsection{Divisibility rules}
These rules transforms a given number into a generally smaller number while preserving divisibility by the divisor of interest.

\begin{compactenum}
	\scriptsize
	\setcounter{enumi}{1}
	\item Last digit.
	\item Sum of digits.
	\item Last two digits.
	\item Last digit.
	\item Divisible by 2 and 3, or\\
		add the last digit to four times the sum of all other digits.
	\item Form the alternating sum of blocks of three digits, from right to left, or
		subtract 2 times the last digit from the rest, or\\
		add 5 times the last digit to the rest.
	\item Last three digits.
	\item Sum of digits.
	\item Last digit.
	\item Alternating sum of digits, or
		add the digits in blocks of two from right to left, or
		subtract the last digit from the rest.
	\item Divisible by 3 and 4, or
		subtract the last digit from twice the rest.
	\item Form the alternating sum of blocks of three digits, from right to left, or
		add 4 times the last digit to the rest.
	\item Divisible by 2 and 7, or
		add the last two digits to twice the rest.
	\item Divisible by 3 and 5.
	\item Last four digits, or
		add the last two digits to four times the rest.
	\item Subtract 5 times the last digit from the rest.
	\item Divisible by 2 and 9.
	\item Add twice the last digit to the rest.
	\item Last two digits.
