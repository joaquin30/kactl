Description: Returns true if p lies within the polygon described by the points between iterators begin and end. If strict false is returned when p is on the edge of the polygon. If epsilon is provided p is considered beeing on the edge when it is within a distance epsilon from it. Answer is calculated by counting the number of intersections between the polygon and a line going from p to infinity in the positive x-direction. The algorithm uses products in intermediate steps so watch out for overflow.
Time: O(n)
Status: tested
Usage:
	typedef Point<int> pi;
	vector<pi> v; v.push_back(pi(4,4));
	v.push_back(pi(1,2)); v.push_back(pi(2,1));
	bool in = insidePolygon(v.begin(),v.end(), pi(3,4), false);
