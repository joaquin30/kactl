 * Description: A connected graph has a tree decomposition based on biconnected
 * components. Block-nodes represent groups of nodes and are formed from the
 * nodes in each component \emph{and} for each pair of nodes connected by a
 * bridge. One AP-node is created for each articulation point. Add edges from
 * AP-nodes to each block the AP is in.
