This file should contain a general introduction to modifying the KACTL:

The general file structure, where to find/place code, tests and documentation.

How to build the KACTL, including prerequisites.

How to modify the .tex files to add new chapters, new files, change title etc.

How the code annotation works.

How the test framework works.

And probably a lot more.
Unfortunately it doesn't contain that much at the moment, but good luck anyway :-)
